  # unit tests for aggregate_member
  # Aggregate member
  # Calling this endpoint initiates an aggregation event for the member. This brings in the latest account and transaction data from the connected institution. If this data has recently been updated, MX may not initiate an aggregation event.
  # @param member_guid The unique id for a &#x60;member&#x60;.
  # @param user_guid The unique identifier for a &#x60;user&#x60;, beginning with the prefix &#x60;USR-&#x60;.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :x_callback_payload The base64 encoded string defined in this header will be returned in the [Member](/resources/webhooks/member/) and [Member Data Updated](/resources/webhooks/member#member-data-updated) webhooks. This allows you to trace user interactions and workflows initiated externally and internally in the MX Platform. Max 1024 characters.

  # unit tests for create_member
  # Create member
  # This endpoint allows you to create a new member. Members are created with the required parameters credentials and institution_code, and the optional parameters id and metadata. When creating a member, youll need to include the correct type of credential required by the financial institution and provided by the user. You can find out which credential type is required with the &#x60;/institutions/{institution_code}/credentials&#x60; endpoint. If successful, the MX Platform API will respond with the newly-created member object. Once you successfully create a member, MX will immediately validate the provided credentials and attempt to aggregate data for accounts and transactions.
  # @param user_guid The unique identifier for a &#x60;user&#x60;, beginning with the prefix &#x60;USR-&#x60;.
  # @param member_create_request_body Member object to be created with optional parameters (id and metadata) and required parameters (credentials and institution_code)
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :x_callback_payload The base64 encoded string defined in this header will be returned in the [Member](/resources/webhooks/member/) and [Member Data Updated](/resources/webhooks/member#member-data-updated) webhooks. This allows you to trace user interactions and workflows initiated externally and internally in the MX Platform. Max 1024 characters.

  # List member challenges
  # Use this endpoint for information on what multi-factor authentication challenges need to be answered in order to aggregate a member. If the aggregation is not challenged, i.e., the member does not have a connection status of &#x60;CHALLENGED&#x60;, then code &#x60;204 No Content&#x60; will be returned. If the aggregation has been challenged, i.e., the member does have a connection status of &#x60;CHALLENGED&#x60;, then code &#x60;200 OK&#x60; will be returned - along with the corresponding credentials.

  # This endpoint provides the status of the members most recent aggregation event. This is an important step in the aggregation process, and the results returned by this endpoint should determine what you do next in order to successfully aggregate a member. MX has introduced new, more detailed information on the current status of a members connection to a financial institution and the state of its aggregation - the connection_status field. These are intended to replace and expand upon the information provided in the status field, which will soon be deprecated; support for the status field remains for the time being.
